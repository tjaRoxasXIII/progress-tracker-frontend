# README

After cloning down this repository, begin by running `npm install` to grab the needed dependencies.  This application was designed to be used in conjunction with the Progress Tracker Backend which can be found here(https://github.com/tjaRoxasXIII/progress-tracker-backend).

All routes are configured to look for the backend being hosted on http://localhost:3000 so it is recommended to start up your Rails server first before continuing.  Alternatively you can choose to go through the src files and manually configure your routes.

Once that has been completed, run `npm start` and choose 'Y' when prompted to begin running this application on http://localhost:3001.  You can then navigate to that location within your browser and begin using the application.
